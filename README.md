## Description
The following files contain the working Quiz on gaming. Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and web api's I was able to pull togehter a quiz about some of my favorite games. This quiz goes through gaming questions about games I know about. I want to see if anyone else had the same childhood as me.

## Breakdown
I created a quiz for gamers, to see what they know about games that I played growing up. I was able to create five questions about games and their multiple choice. I started off with HTML, created a rule box to ensure the player knew what they were going into. Created more containers for the questions and the end result. The result will show what you got and if you wanted tp play again. The CSS seems to be getting easier for me. I used google fonts for the first time and also a site known as https://fontawesome.com/start for the emojis.
